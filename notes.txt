In order to successfully redirect the packet we need to
push 4 rules to the edge switch (switch, that is receiving initial request):

- Outgoing ARP and IP: 
replace target ip with ip of cache
- Incoming ARP and IP: replace source ip (cache is responding) with target ip.

On switch before cache server we change destination port to 3128
